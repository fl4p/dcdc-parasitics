# Implementation plan — KiCad → FastHenry power-stage parasitic extractor

## Context

Generalize the Fugu2 FastHenry commutation-loop extractor into a reusable
`dcdc-tools` tool. Given any `.kicad_pcb` + the **GND net** and **switch-node
net**, compute the half-bridge power-stage parasitic **L and R**, useful for:

- **HS gate-drive analysis with common-source inductance (CSI)** — the HS gate
  loop overlaps the shoot-through high-current path through the FET source lead,
  so the shared source inductance couples power di/dt into the gate loop.
- **Switch-node peak-voltage / ringing** — commutation loop L (+ Coss).

Primary output: a generated SPICE subcircuit (+ JSON), plus a Markdown report.
Scope: full half-bridge (HS + LS gate loops and both common-source inductances).

## Approach (as built)

One FastHenry solve, three ports → full mutual-inductance matrix:

| Port | Across | Gives |
|------|--------|-------|
| `P_pwr` | nearest Cin (Vin↔GND) | commutation loop L, R |
| `P_ghs` | HS gate driver-end ↔ HS gate return | HS gate-loop L |
| `P_gls` | LS gate driver-end ↔ LS gate return | LS gate-loop L |

FET channels shorted at the die plane and gates closed to source there, so
`P_pwr` traces the full `Cin→HS→SW→LS→GND→Cin` shoot-through loop and each gate
loop shares that FET's source lead. **CSI = mutual `M(P_pwr, P_gate)`** — the
shared source-lead partial inductance. Gate-return node position encodes Kelvin
(CSI excluded) vs non-Kelvin (CSI included). Emitted subckt expresses CSI as a
**shared source-lead branch** (`Lscs_*`).

Meshing: tracks→filaments; pours→gridded mesh clipped to the filled polygon and to
an ROI around the FETs/Cin; vias→vertical filaments; THT pads + FET leads→vertical
stubs to a die plane. Nodes interned by `(net, layer, snapped-xy)` (coincident-
node fix); every track/via/pad bonded to its pour; union-find prune to
port-reachable copper. `L = Im(Z)/2πf`, `R = Re(Z)` at a low-MHz plateau.
`nwinc/nhinc` default to 1 (fast; L-plateau barely affected) — raise for HF R.

## Files (`parasitics/`)

- `fet_discovery.py` — pcbnew auto-ID of HS/LS FETs, Vin, gate nets, Cin, Kelvin.
- `kicad_geom.py` — pcbnew → multiport FastHenry `.inp` (mesh engine).
- `solve_reduce.py` — run fasthenry, parse Zc.mat, reduce to named parasitics.
- `emit.py` — parasitics → `parasitics.lib` (shared-branch CSI) + `.json` + `report.md`.
- `extract_parasitics.py` — CLI orchestrator (KiCad-python geom + system-python solve).

## Verification

Validated on `mppt-2420-hc` (4-layer buck; SW `/DC/DC/SW_NODE`, HS `Q1`, LS `Q2`,
Vin `/DCDC_HV+`): all three ports connected (no NaN), loop L ≈ 8.5 nH, CSI_hs ≈
0.7 nH, CSI_ls ≈ 1.4 nH at 2 mm pitch — physically sane for a compact half-bridge.

Follow-ups: golden regression on the Fugu2 board (needs `~/Documents` TCC access);
automatic Kelvin detection; mesh-convergence sweep at finer pitch.
